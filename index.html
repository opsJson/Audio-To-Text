  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    The <strong>Audio to Text for Whatsapp Web</strong> extension respects and values the privacy of its users. This privacy policy describes how we handle the information we collect when you use our extension.
  </p>

  <h2>Collection and Use of Information</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Audio to Text for Whatsapp Web</strong> extension is designed to convert audio received on Whatsapp into text, making it easier for users to communicate through text. By using our extension, you may submit audio for transcription.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use OpenAI's Whiser API to transcribe audio into text. When you submit audio, it is transmitted to the Whiser API solely for transcription purposes. We do not store or retain the audio submitted for transcription, nor do we keep the transcription results after they are delivered to you.
  </p>

  <h2>Security and Storage</h2>
  <p>
    It is important to note that we do not store any audio sent for transcription on our servers or anywhere else. All processing is carried out on a temporary and transitory basis to provide you with the requested transcript, and the results are sent directly back to you on Whatsapp.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By using the <strong>Audio to Text for Whatsapp Web</strong> extension, you expressly consent to the transmission of your audio to OpenAI's Whiser API for transcription purposes as described in this privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by notifying users through updates to the extension or on our website.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:cleversonpelegrini@gmail.com">cleversonpelegrini@gmail.com</a>
